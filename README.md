# Hunter-vs-Speedrunner
This is a plugin using SpigotMC API and Java that emulates the Youtuber Dream's famous hunter vs speedrunner videos. 
This plugin will emulate all the properties of Dream's speedrunner vs. hunter videos in which each speedrunner is equipped with a compass that points to the direction
of the speedrunner at all times and they are not allowed to lose the compass even if the hunter dies.
